      <h3 class="section-header">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="text">The time we can and want to work don’t always overlap, resulting in time being spent inefficiently. Trying to make a realistic schedule can be difficult and time-consuming. Calendar apps allow room for planning ahead, but do very little to focus on helping users complete tasks that day. Users know what they need to get done, but don’t always know the best way to get those things done. Time spent completing the actual tasks is instead devoted to planning the day and inputting task information. </p>
      <br>
      <h5 style="padding-bottom: 16px; opacity: 0.75">Based on initial data gathering, there were a few pain points that were identified&colon;
        <ul>
          <li>Users want information that’s specific to the current day.</li>
          <li>Some apps provide too many options for customizing &amp; categorizing tasks. </li>
          <li>Wishing for more guidance in task priority &amp; planning.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="section-header">A Solution</h3>
      <p class="text">Timekeeper is built to help users become more efficient by eliminating the time spent making daily schedules. By observing phone + internet usage and when you most and least productive, Timekeeper learns and creates the most optimal schedule for you.</p>
      <p class="text">We hoped to solve the problem of task input and task guidance/prioritization.</p>
      <br>
      <h5 style="padding-bottom: 16px; opacity: 0.75">We wanted to build a tool that would:
        <ul>
          <li>help instructors <strong>quickly form teams</strong></li>
          <li><strong>provide instructors with insightful feedback</strong> on team compatibility</li>
          <li><strong>be simple and easy</strong> for instructors to use</li>

      <h3 class="section-header">Timekeeper's Design</h3>
      <p class="text">Timekeeper is designed to be simple. Users are presented with a simple navigation layout that focuses on current tasks and the schedule for the day — This is the bare minimum that allows users to get started immediately without having any roadblocks.</p>

      <p class="text"><strong>Lessons learned</strong></p>
      <p class="text">Keeping track of all the students' information was the biggest problem. Given the many requirements, many participants chose to ignore the soft constraints (&#35; of overlapping schedule availability, &#35; of leaders per team, etc.) and focused their time on the hard constraints (# of students per team, student preferences, etc.) listed. It was a common trend that participants would eventually start to randomly place students together without any regard to the constraints given.</p>

      <p class="text">Teammatic was a research project that served the basis for my friend Carolyn’s thesis. I wanted to help her not only because she was a great person to work with, but because I really empathized with the problem that was presented. Is there really anything worse than a group member who slacks off?<br><br>While designing Teammatic, we already accepted that perfect team formation is impossible. However, we learned that instructors are generally happy with auto-generated teams based on student compatibility, as long as we provided them with the freedom and flexibility to make changes when desired, i.e. a mixed-initiative interface.</p>

      <p class="text"><strong>Moving forward</strong></p>
      <p class="text">The interface is a work in progress, but we are heading in the right direction based on positive user feedback (hooray!). Currently Teammatic only has the ability to generate teams; it has yet to become a fully working product. It would be ideal to incorporate the entire team formation process into Teammatic, from gathering student data, to forming teams, to post-course feedback. <br><br>For now, Teammatic is being used by a few involved professors, who will continue to give us insight into how we can improve the interface and how we might implement new, undiscovered features.
