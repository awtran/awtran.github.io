      <h5 style="padding-bottom: 24px;"><strong>tl&semi;dr&colon;</strong> I worked with a team to design a mobile clothing app aimed to providing users with accurate sizing recommendations based on their preferences across clothing brands.</h5>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <div class="section-div" style="padding-top: 36px">
      <h3 class="section-header">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="text">The idea came from an issue we each saw every time we bought clothes online. It seemed more often than not <strong>the ease of online shopping was overshadowed by the challenge of finding the right size</strong>. It’s hard to know what fits best when there is so much variation in sizing across different brands. People could choose to estimate their size, and then deal with returning clothes if they do not fit. Or, people could spend hours in fitting room. But who really wants to be spending their time doing that?</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="section-header">A Solution</h3>
      <p class="text">Fitted aims to give you the confidence in finding the right-sized clothes with accurate body measurements in order to provide you with personalized sizing recommendations. Users can browse styles from their favorite brands and be given accurate sizing suggestions tailored to their preferences and/or needs.</p>
      <h5 style="padding-bottom: 16px; opacity: 0.75">We hoped to address these key problem areas: finding the right size, establishing trust through sizing recommendations, and streamlining the online shopping experience.</h5>
    </div>

    <!-- Process Section -->

      <h3 class="section-header">Our Process</h3>
      <h5><strong>Information Architecture</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">This IA diagram outlines the different sections a user can take through the Fitted experience:</p>

      </div>

      <h6 class="img-caption">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Homepage</strong>&colon; Browse products based on either brand recommendations by the app or explore current fashion trends. Promotes discoverability and aimed to maintain user attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Liked Products</strong>&colon; The Liked Products section allows users to look back at items they were interested in, but perhaps did not intend to purchase at the moment they discovered it.</li>
          <li><strong>Search</strong>&colon; Specific browsing for items based on brand or design type (shirts, pants, etc.). Includes navigation into Product View, which provides users with information on the selected item such as personalized fitting style and user reviews.</li>
          <li><strong>Shopping Cart</strong>&colon; As with any app that provides an e-commerce experience, a shopping cart is available for users to keep track of to-be purchased items. IA follows that of a standard online-shopping format.</li>
          <li><strong>Profile</strong>&colon; Body preference settings are found here. Users can edit these preferences based on their needs and the app will respond accordingly, i.e. automatically filter results to be within user sizing parameters.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <div class="section-div" style="padding-top: 36px">
      <h3 class="section-header">Design Details</h3>
      <h5><strong>Sizing Recommendations</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">Fitted provides personalized recommendations across all products. For each product view, the user gets an indication of how well the item is going to fit on their body (based on the preferences they provide).</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <img class="landing-img u-max-full-width" style="padding-left: 64px; padding-right: 64px" src="images/fitted-productDetails.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text">Each item the user views will have a percentage that informs them of how accurate the fit will be based on their size. The option can be changed, giving users freedom and flexibility to choose how well the item should fit them. Reviews also further inform users because we understand the importance of having constant feedback from real-world experiences.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <img class="landing-img u-max-full-width" style="padding-left: 48px; padding-right: 48px" src="images/fitted-flowProgression.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text">This is the bread and butter of Fitted. Users have the freedom to adjust their body profile based on their own preferences. Whether users want an overall tighter fit in the clothes they buy, or only in the torso length, they have the ability to indicate that and Fitted will filter and tailor their results accordingly.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="seven columns">

    <hr style="border: 0; height: 0; border-top: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);">

    <!-- Next Steps Section -->
    <div class="section-div" style="padding-top: 36px">
      <h3 class="section-header">Next Steps</h3>
      <p class="text">There’s a lot I would like to do with future features. My ideal next steps would be&colon; <strong>personalized styling recommendations</strong> (shoutout to Amazon Echo) and <strong>C2C marketplace capability</strong> for renting and selling unused clothing. Providing these features will allow for a better in-app experience, and I hope the data we collect will help validate these decisions.</p>

      <p class="text">The realm of online shopping is always expanding and having certain, personalized information at our fingertips can better help us in finding the right clothes.</p>
