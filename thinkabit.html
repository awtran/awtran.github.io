            Qualcomm's Thinkabit Lab is a makerspace for Qualcomm employees & family members to tinker with the technology they offer, such as their Arduino boards.

            <br /><br />

            The problem with the space is that it can be quite intimidating for newcomers and even returners who are unsure how to proceed. It was an opportunity to develop a strong understanding of the physical and cognitive space by leading user interviews and conducting ethnographic research.

            <br /><br />

            We were able to improve the user interaction flow within the Lab by designing an informational pamphlet for the onboarding process.

Each time we met at the Thinkabit Lab, the work was distributed in a way that provided equal attention to both research (i.e. interviews, observations) and prototype development. Aside from in-class discussions, we also designated 1-2 times to meet outside to update weekly progress via a GoogleDoc.</h3>

          <h3 class="f6 f5-ns fw4 mt2 black-60 worksans lh-copy">
            One of the leading ideas was to re-organize the space and put up labels, but that only helped solve 2 of the categories. In the end, we decided to make a pamphlet, as we felt it was the best solution that could address the variety of problem areas.

            <br /><br />

            For the pamphlet we worked to go through several stages of testing. At first, we had a simple version that was created by folding together paper, with post-it notes on each page that included the potential item that would go there. These included a map, table of contents, and list of materials.

          <h3 class="f6 f5-ns fw4 mt2 black-60 worksans lh-copy">Continued interviews with employees helped determine the layout of the pamphlet. Since we planned on having the pamphlet available in the lab as well, we asked people to look at a prototype and observed where they looked first to help further determine ordering of pages.</h3>
