      <h3 class="section-header">Qualcomm Thinkabit Lab</h3>
      <p class="text">Our design focus revolved around Qualcomm's Thinkabit Lab, a makerspace for Qualcomm employees &amp; family members to tinker with the technology Qualcomm has, such as their Arduino boards. The problem with the Thinkabit Lab is that it can be quite intimidating for newcomers and even returners who are unsure how to proceed.</p>

      <h5 style="padding-bottom: 16px; opacity: 0.75">Poor organization of space &amp; limited guidance led to confused users, which led to <strong>low retention rate</strong> and a <strong>lacking experience</strong>.</h5>

      <h5><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">We conducted two competitive analyses and interviews to better understand existing makerspaces. From this we learned about some existing features of similar makerspace environments that generate a beneficial and immersive experience.</p>

      </div>

      <h5><strong>The Needs</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">We conducted several interviews with employees &amp; observed individuals throughout their experience. Initial findings made it clear that there was a lack of general information as well as available materials. A lack of provided help lead to frustrated users&colon;</p>

    <!-- Implementation Section -->
    <div class="section-div" style="padding-top: 36px">
      <h3 class="section-header">Ideation to Implementation</h3>
      <p class="text">We developed a pseudo-Agile approach to better streamline our goals. Each time we met at the Thinkabit Lab, the work was distributed in a way that provided equal attention to both research (i.e. interviews, observations) and prototype development. Aside from in-class discussions, we also designated 1-2 times to meet outside to update weekly progress via a GoogleDoc.</p>

      <h5><strong>Conducting Research</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">While our target audience was predetermined, we still had to find ways to empathize with this group of people. Initial interactions determined a wide range of experience levels among users; better categorization &amp; understanding the specific needs of each of these subgroups would be essential.</p>

      <h5 style="padding-bottom: 16px; opacity: 0.75">There were a lot of first-time users, and a lot of confusion getting started. Our findings were broken down into 5 main categories.</h5>

      <div class="row">

    <div class="section-div" style="padding-top: 36px">
      <h3 class="section-header">Prototypes</h3>
      <p class="text">One of the leading ideas was to re-organize the space and put up labels, but that only helped solve 2 of the categories. In the end, we decided to make a pamphlet, as we felt it was the best solution that could address the variety of problem areas.</p>

      <p class="text">For the pamphlet I worked with Alex and Sophia to go through several stages of testing. At first, we had a simple version that was created by folding together paper, with post-it notes on each page that included the potential item that would go there. These included a map, table of contents, and list of materials.</p>

      <!-- Pamphlet picture -->

          <img class="landing-img inline-img u-max-full-width" src="images/thinkabit-pamphlet1.jpeg">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text">Continued interviews with employees helped determine the layout of the pamphlet. Since we planned on having the pamphlet available in the lab as well, we asked people to look at a prototype and observed where they looked first to help further determine ordering of pages.</p>

      <p class="text">The results showed that the majority of people thought tracking progress should go on page 5 (70&#37;). The map should go on page 3 (30&#37;) or 6 (30). The list of materials should go on page 4 (50&#37;). The profile of hosts should go on page 3 (40&#37;). The purpose of the lab should go on page 2 (60&#37;), and the table of contents should go on page 1 (70&#37;) or may not be needed (30&#37;).</p>

This was driven our findings of 1) difficulty of navigating the space, and 2) understanding what is available to use.</li>
          <li><strong>Description</strong>&colon; briefly explains the purpose of the Lab. Users get a sense of the experience before digging deeper. The goal was to provide users, especially first-timers, a sense of comfort wih the vast array of materials provided. A better onboarding process would easily reduce the need for troubleshooting.</li>

      <p class="text">Our design solution includes several parts. A redesigned email sent out to employees addresses any false assumptions prior to attending. A simple overview explains the purpose of the Lab, tells people what materials are available. An attached pamphlet (pictured above) explains the Lab in more detail.</p>
