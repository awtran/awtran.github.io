    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <div class="section-div" style="padding-top: 36px">
      <h3 class="section-header">Qualcomm Thinkabit Lab</h3>
      <p class="text">Our design focus revolved around Qualcomm's Thinkabit Lab, on their Thursday "Tinkering Nights". It's a chance for Qualcomm employees to bring their family members in to play around with some of the technology Qualcomm has to offer, such as their Arduino boards.</p>
      <p class="text">The problem with the Thinkabit Lab is that it can be quite intimidating for newcomers and even returners who are unsure how to proceed. The lab space is poorly organized. Due to the small amount of hosts, people are not always greeted when they enter which leads to further confusion and intimidation. When this occurs people are much less likely to enjoy their experience and return in the following weeks.</p>

      <h5><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">In the beginning, we had a very vague understanding of our design opportunity. We knew we would be helping Qualcomm employees engage in tinkering and building activities, but did not know the manner in which to do so. Therefore, we each conducted two competitive analyses and interviews to better understand the existing services and organizations that utilize a type of "makerspace". From this we learned about some existing features of similar makerspace environments that generate a beneficial and immersive experience.</p>

      </div>

      <h5><strong>The Needs</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">For our first trip, we wanted to obtain a better understanding of the problem areas within the lab. Therefore, we conducted several interviews with the employees to find out what they felt were the main issues. We also observed individuals while they were tinkering and navigating throughout the lab. After our initial findings, it became clear that there was a lack of general information on the Lab, as well as what materials were available to use. This, coupled with a lack of provided help led to frustrated users&colon;</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Ideation to Implementation</h3>
      <p class="text">Having 10 weeks to complete this project, my team and I developed a pseudo-Agile approach to better streamline our goals. Each time we met at the Thinkabit Lab, the work was distributed in a way that provided equal attention to both research (i.e. interviews, observations) and prototype development. Aside from in-class discussions, we also designated 1-2 times to meet outside to update weekly progress via a GoogleDoc.</p>

      <h5><strong>Sizing Recommendations</strong></h5>
      <p class="text">Fitted provides personalized recommendations across all products. For each product view, the user gets an indication of how well the item is going to fit on their body (based on the preferences they provide).</p>

      <div class="row">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text">Each item the user views will have a percentage that informs them of how accurate the fit will be based on their size. The option can be changed, giving users freedom and flexibility to choose how well the item should fit them. Reviews also further inform users because we understand the importance of having constant feedback from real-world experiences.</p>

      <div class="row">

      </div>

      <p class="text">This is the bread and butter of Fitted. Users have the freedom to adjust their body profile based on their own preferences. Whether users want an overall tighter fit in the clothes they buy, or only in the torso length, they have the ability to indicate that and Fitted will filter and tailor their results accordingly.</p>

      <p class="text">There’s a lot I would like to do with future features. My ideal next steps would be&colon; <strong>personalized styling recommendations</strong> (shoutout to Amazon Echo) and <strong>C2C marketplace capability</strong> for renting and selling unused clothing. Providing these features will allow for a better in-app experience, and I hope the data we collect will help validate these decisions.</p>
